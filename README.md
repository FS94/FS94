- 👋 Hi, I’m Fábio and I'm from Aveiro, Portugal.
- 🎓 I’m currently a PhD student in Psychology at the University of Aveiro, exploring the link between anxiety and perceptual deficits in social scene interpretation.
- 📈 Aside from anything neuro-related, I'm also interested in data and data analysis.
